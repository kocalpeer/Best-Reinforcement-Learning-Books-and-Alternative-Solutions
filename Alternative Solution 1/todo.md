# TODO:
---------

## LaTeX
- read some latex docs to learn it properly
- figure out how to typeset algorithms 
- sort out the saving of images as eps (maybe you will need to put them into the same directory as the tex files)
- figure out some sort of latex command that can use a template document to compile the contents files (to save having chapterX.tex)


## code
- docstrings
- tests for bandit problems code (and everything else...)
- fix weird virtual environment behaviour (root conda getting in the way when you type source). Can't activate env atm
- update requirements file
- all the shebangs at the top of the scripts may be wrong given the virtual environments
- change the policies etc. from hashmaps to arrays (?)
